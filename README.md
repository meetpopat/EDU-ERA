Introduction-

At present students have to use multiple apps to fulfill their educational needs. These multiple apps often put an extra cognitive load on students. Since we have also faced the same issue thus we decided to make an app that contains all the essential features in order to provide a hassle-free experience of multiple apps. We followed the double diamond design process in our design of the app. We first made a form that asked the user about their current experience with these apps, and as expected, the majority of them replied that at one point or another they had some problem regarding managing all those apps and appreciated the idea of an all-in-one educational app. Then we made multiple designs and finally selected the most suitable one according to us. The only challenge we faced was in getting a large number of real-time student feedback on our design. Thus we made a form that described our HI-FI prototype and had both open and close-ended questions and then floated it on our college Whatsapp groups and if needed, we floated it again so that an adequate no of responses are received. Then we tried to implement suggestions of the stakeholders and finalized our prototype accordingly.
